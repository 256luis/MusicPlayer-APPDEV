It's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig?
It's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig?
But, if it's raining in Manila, hindi kita maririnig
So, I'll be waiting in Manila kahit di ka na babalik

Maulan ba sa inyo 'pag bumubuhos dito?
Paumanhin at mukhang hindi ko
Masasabayan ang 'yong yapak
Sa pagngiti at pag-iyak
Sa paglipad at pagbagsak ng araw-araw
Sa pagpikit na lang kita
Matititigan sa mata
Sa panaginip na magpapaligaw

Kamusta ka na? Kahit 'wag nang sagutin
'Di ba nawala ang kintab ng bituin?
Sana ganun ka nga pa rin

'Cause, it's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig?
Mahirap bang mag-isang nanginginig?
And it's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig
'Pag wala ang mga tala?
Madilim ba ang mundo?

May kulang ba sa inyo na naiwan dito?
Aanhin ang ulan sa paradiso?
Sakali madulas ay dati malapit ka
Ngayon walang kahati ng init 'pag maulan
Sana naman tumigil na ang ulan

Kamusta ka na? Kahit 'wag nang sagutin
'Di ba nawala ang kintab ng bituin?
Sana ganun ka nga pa rin

'Cause, it's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig?
Mahirap bang mag-isang nanginginig?
And it's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig
'Pag wala ang mga tala?
Madilim ba ang mundo?

Kamusta ka na? Kahit 'wag nang sagutin
'Di ba nawala ang kintab ng bituin?
Sana ganun ka nga pa rin

But, if it's raining in Manila, hindi kita maririnig
Nakahiga, mag-isang nanginginig
So, I'll be waiting in Manila kahit 'di ka na babalik
Andiyan lang ang mga tala, andiyan lang ang mga tala
Saan mang sulok ng mundo

[English translation:]

It's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold?
It's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold?
But, if it's raining in Manila, I won't be able to hear you
(Lying down all alone, shivering)
So, I'll be waiting in Manila even if you won't be coming back

Is it raining there when it's pouring here?
I'm sorry if I won't be able
To follow your footsteps
In crying, In laughing
In flying and ending the day with you
Closing my eyes is the only way
I'll be able to stare at you
I'll get myself lost in my dreams

How are you doing? You don't have to answer it
Did the star lost its shine?
I hope you're still the same

'Cause, it's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold?
Is it hard shivering alone?
And it's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold
If the stars disappeared?
Will the world be dark?

Did you left something you forgot here?
What are you gonna do with the rain in paradise?
In case I slipped, at least you're close
Now there's no warmth when it rains
I hope the rain stops

How are you? You don't have to answer it
Did the star lost its shine?
I hope you're still the same

'Cause, it's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold?
Is it hard shivering alone?
And it's been raining in Manila, aren't you getting cold
If the stars disappeared?
Will the world be dark?

How are you? You don't have to answer it
Did the star lost its shine?
I hope you didn't changed

But, if it's raining in Manila, I won't be able to hear you
Lying down all alone, shivering
So, I'll be waiting in Manila even if you won't be coming back
The stars are there, The stars are there
In every corner of the world
