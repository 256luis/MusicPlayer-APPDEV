I remember the times we spent together on those drives
We had a million questions all about our lives
And when we got to New York, everything felt right
I wish you were here with me tonight

I remember the days we spent together were not enough
And it used to feel like dreaming except we always woke up
Never thought not having you here now would hurt so much

Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight

I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in and the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late

I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus
And how not to look back even if no one believes us
When it hurts so bad sometimes not having you here

I sing
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight

I sing
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
And know the stars are holding you, holding you, holding you tonight
